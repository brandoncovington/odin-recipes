    <h1>Onion Rings</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These are a big hit with my family. My son usually won't eat onions, but he devours onion rings without any protest.</p>
    <p>The secret to these is double-dipping. This creates a beautifully crispy crust. Once cooked, the onions inside are tender and sweet. That strong raw onion flavor fades to the background, replaced with the crispy outer coating and seasoning. Here's why you will love this recipe:</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sweet or yellow onion</strong> - The larger the onion, the better when it comes to onion rings</li>
        <li><strong>Milk</strong> - use any king of milk (1%,2% or whole milk)</li>
        <li><strong>White vinegar</strong> - creates homemade buttermilk when added to milk</li>
        <li><strong>Sour Cream</strong> - Helps thicken the liquid so it clings to the onion rings</li>
        <li><strong>All-purpose flour</strong> - creates a light batter similar to a restaurant-style tempura batter</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong> - we use fine sea salt for most of our cooking</li>
        <li><strong>Black pepper</strong> - freshly ground black pepper will give the best flavor</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic powder</strong> - adds so much flavor to the batter</li>
        <li><strong>Oil for frying</strong> - use grapeseed oil, peanut oil, canola, or oil with a high smoke point</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Heat the Oil</strong> - heat a large dutch oven over medium heat with about an inch of oil</li>
        <li><strong>Make the liquid Mixture</strong> - In a medium bowl, whisk the milk with the vinegar and let it sit for 5 minutes. Whisk in the sour cream.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Dry Mixture</strong> - In a seperate bowl, mix together the flour, salt, black pepper, and the garlic powder</li>
        <li><strong>Dredge the Onions</strong> - Slice and separate the onion rings and dep each ring in the sour cream mixture, followed by the flour (using a fork will keep your hands clean). <strong>Repeat</strong> by dipping the rings a second time in the milk mixture and flour. Transfer to a plate and repeat with remaining onion rings</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Onion Rings</strong> - Once the oil is hot enough for onion rings to sizzle (375 degrees on a thermonmeter) , add them in a single layer (3-4 at a time) and fry for 3 to 4 minutes, flipping halfway, or until the outside is crispy and light golden brown. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate.</li>
    </ol>
